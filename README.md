#Hopfield Neural Network Model


---


The [Paper](https://github.com/msilver22/Hopfield_model/blob/main/Hopfield.pdf) is an overview on the theory background and explains fully my experiment. It begins with an overview of the model's foundations, incorporating insights from mechanical statistics to deepen our understanding. Then it focus on **Audio Retrieval** and the Hopfield model's associative memory capabilities. In particular,the network will be trained to retrieve different vocal patterns.
