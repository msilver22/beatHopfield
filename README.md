This repository delves into the **Hopfield Neural Network Model**.


---


The [Paper](https://github.com/msilver22/Hopfield_model/blob/main/Hopfield.pdf) begins with an overview of the model's foundations, incorporating insights from mechanical statistics to deepen our understanding. Focusing on **Audio Retrieval**, the codes show the Hopfield model's associative memory capabilities. In particular,the network will be trained to retrieve different patterns.
